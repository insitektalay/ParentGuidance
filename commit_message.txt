feat: Complete framework removal functionality with confirmation dialog

This commit implements the complete framework removal workflow for the Settings tab Foundation Tools section:

- Added frameworkRemovalConfirmationOverlay view to SettingsView that displays when showingRemovalConfirmation is true
- Implemented confirmation dialog using existing ConfirmationDialog component following LibraryView deletion pattern
- Added semi-transparent background overlay that cancels removal when tapped outside dialog
- Custom confirmation message warns users about permanent framework removal
- Dynamic button text shows "Removing..." state during async removal operation
- Proper z-index (2000) ensures dialog appears above all other UI elements
- Connects to existing removal state management (prepareForRemoval, cancelRemoval, removeFramework methods)
- Maintains UI consistency with existing app confirmation dialog patterns

Framework removal now provides proper user confirmation before permanent deletion from database, completing the core Foundation Tools
management functionality.
