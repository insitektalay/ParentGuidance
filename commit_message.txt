feat: implement version-based prompt selection for dynamic guidance structure

Complete Step 3 of dynamic guidance structure implementation by adding intelligent prompt version selection based on user preferences.

## Key Features Added:
- Settings integration in NewSituationView with GuidanceStructureSettings @StateObject
- Dynamic prompt version selection based on user's guidance structure mode preference
- Conditional logic to choose appropriate prompt versions for each mode

## Technical Implementation:
- **Fixed Mode**: Uses existing prompt versions (v12 no framework, v3 with framework) to preserve current 7-section behavior
- **Dynamic Mode**: Uses newer prompt versions (v16 no framework, v4 with framework) designed for 3-8 flexible sections
- **Same Prompt IDs**: Leverages existing prompt infrastructure with version-based differentiation:
  - No framework: pmpt_68515280423c8193aaa00a07235b7cf206c51d869f9526ba
  - With framework: pmpt_68516f961dc08190aceb4f591ee010050a454989b0581453

## Code Changes:
- Added @StateObject private var guidanceStructureSettings to NewSituationView.swift
- Updated generateGuidance() function with conditional version selection logic
- Replaced hardcoded version numbers with dynamic selection based on isUsingDynamicStructure

## User Experience:
- Fixed Mode users continue to receive structured 7-section guidance unchanged
- Dynamic Mode users will receive AI-generated flexible sections (when parser is implemented)
- Immediate response to preference changes in Settings
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

This completes Step 3 of the 6-step implementation plan, establishing the prompt infrastructure needed for Step 4 (Dynamic Parser) while
maintaining full backward compatibility.
