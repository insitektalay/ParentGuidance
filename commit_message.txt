refactor: complete SettingsView.swift modularization reducing file size by 78%\
\
Completes Phase 3 & 4 of comprehensive SettingsView refactoring, transforming a monolithic 2512-line file into a clean, modular architecture of \
542 lines.\
\
Phase 3 extractions:\
- Created 4 focused section views (GuidanceStructureSection, ChildProfileSection, AccountSection, HelpSupportSection)\
- Extracted 6 reusable components (GuidanceModeCard, FrameworkCard, LanguageSelectionView, etc.)\
- Modularized 3 confirmation dialog components for account management\
\
Phase 4 service architecture:\
- SettingsDataService: Handles data export and account deletion operations\
- SettingsAccountService: Manages profile loading, language updates, and child profiles\
- SettingsFormatterService: Centralizes display text formatting logic\
- SettingsUtilityService: Provides utility functions for email support and app info\
\
Key improvements:\
- Enhanced maintainability through focused component responsibilities\
- Improved testability with independently testable service classes\
- Better code reusability across the application\
- Reduced compilation overhead and improved development experience\
- Proper dependency injection and loose coupling throughout\
\
All functionality preserved with clean build verification. Maintains existing localization patterns and follows established SwiftUI \
conventions.
