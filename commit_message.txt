feat: implement framework-integrated guidance generation

Add conditional OpenAI prompt selection based on active foundational frameworks. When a family has an active framework, the system now uses a   specialized prompt that incorporates framework-specific guidance.

Key Changes:

- Updated generateGuidance() function to accept optional FrameworkRecommendation parameter
- Added conditional prompt selection logic:
  - No framework: uses existing prompt (pmpt_68515280423c8193aaa00a07235b7cf206c51d869f9526ba v12) with current_situation and family_context   variables
  - Active framework: uses framework-integrated prompt (pmpt_68516f961dc08190aceb4f591ee010050a454989b0581453 v3) with current_situation and   active_foundation_tools variables
- Integrated FrameworkStorageService to detect active frameworks before API calls
- Enhanced handleSendMessage() workflow to include framework detection step
- Framework data is formatted as "FrameworkName: NotificationText" for the prompt variable

This enables the AI to provide guidance that's informed by the family's chosen foundational framework (e.g., Zones of Regulation, Focus Map)   while maintaining backward compatibility for families without active frameworks.
