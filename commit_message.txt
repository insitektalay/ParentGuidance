feat: implement single-tap inline voice recording with text integration

Complete redesign of voice recording UX from two-step navigation to seamless single-tap inline recording. Users can now record voice directly
within the text input area, edit transcribed text, and append multiple recordings without leaving the input screen.

## Key Features Implemented:
- **Single-tap recording**: Mic button starts recording immediately (no navigation)
- **Visual feedback**: Pulsing red button with glow effects and voice indicator waves
- **Text integration**: Transcribed text appears in input field for editing
- **Multiple recordings**: Support appending additional voice recordings to existing text
- **Smart spacing**: Automatic spacing between typed and voice content

## Technical Changes:
- **SituationInputIdleView**: Added VoiceRecorderViewModel integration and transcription handling
- **MicButton**: Updated to use recording state parameter instead of binding, enhanced visual feedback
- **SituationFollowUpView**: Fixed MicButton parameter compatibility (binding â†’ value)
- **SituationVoiceView**: Updated for VoiceRecorderViewModel method signature changes
- **NewSituationView**: Added apiKey parameter passing for transcription functionality

## Implementation Details:
- Integrated VoiceRecorderViewModel directly into SituationInputIdleView
- Modified handleTranscriptionComplete() to insert/append text to input field
- Updated MicButton interface from @Binding to direct Bool parameter
- Added proper error handling for recording operations
- Maintained existing keyboard detection and UI responsiveness

## User Experience:
- Single tap to start recording (mic â†’ stop icon transformation)
- Rich visual feedback with pulsing animation and voice waves
- Transcription appears in editable text field
- Can record multiple times to build longer messages
- Seamless integration with existing text input workflow
