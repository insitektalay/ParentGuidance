feat: fix scrolling issues in Library situation cards by resolving gesture conflicts    Replace exclusive DragGesture with simultaneousGesture in SituationCard to allow vertical scrolling while preserving swipe-to-delete   functionality. Added directional logic that only activates horizontal swipe gestures for delete action, allowing vertical movements to pass   through to ScrollView for smooth scrolling. This brings Library card scrolling behavior in line with situation type picker cards.
