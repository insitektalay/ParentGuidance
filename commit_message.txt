  - Remove Vercel AI SDK dependencies that are incompatible with Deno runtime
  - Replace all streamText calls with native fetch to OpenAI Chat Completions API
  - Maintain prompt template usage and variable interpolation
  - Simulate streaming responses for iOS EdgeFunctionService compatibility
  - Add JSON response format for operations expecting structured output
  - Ensure all code is Deno-compatible for successful Supabase deployment
