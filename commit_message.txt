fix: resolve Dynamic structure mode being ignored in guidance generation

Fixed critical bug where user's Dynamic structure mode setting was being overridden by hardcoded "fixed" values in GuidanceGenerationService.

The system was always using Fixed mode prompts regardless of user toggle preference.

Changes:
  - Updated streamGuidanceViaEdgeFunction() and generateGuidanceViaEdgeFunctionStreaming() methods
  - Replaced hardcoded structureMode: "fixed" with dynamic reading from GuidanceStructureSettings.shared
  - Now properly respects user's choice between Fixed and Dynamic guidance structure modes
  - Ensures Dynamic mode uses the correct prompt templates for more flexible guidance responses

This resolves the issue where users selecting Dynamic mode would still receive Fixed-structure guidance responses.
