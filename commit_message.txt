feat: integrate psychologist notes into guidance generation system

Backend Integration Changes:
- Updated promptTemplates.ts: Removed family_context, added child_context and key_insights variables
- Updated EdgeFunction handler: Process new psychologist notes variables instead of family_context
- Updated EdgeFunctionService.swift: Modified streamGuidance() method signature to accept optional childContext and keyInsights
- Updated GuidanceGenerationService.swift: Complete method signature overhaul to remove familyContext and add psychologist notes support
- Updated NewSituationView.swift: Added psychologist notes fetching with settings-based conditional logic

Key Implementation Details:
- Psychologist notes only fetched when toggles are enabled in GuidanceStructureSettings
- Graceful fallback when notes don't exist (non-blocking errors)
- Maintains backward compatibility for Dynamic structure mode
- Complete removal of family_context system across all services
- Build successful with full integration working end-to-end

The feature now supports dynamic inclusion of child context and key insights from stored psychologist notes in guidance responses based on user
toggle preferences.
