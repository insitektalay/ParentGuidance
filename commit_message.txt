Fix microphone functionality in New Situation screen

The microphone button in the card-based interface was non-functional due to improper state management. The voice recorder view model was being   created locally in SituationInputIdleView instead of being shared from the parent NewSituationView.

Changes:
- Pass voiceRecorderViewModel from NewSituationView to SituationInputIdleView as a parameter
- Update SituationInputIdleView to use @ObservedObject instead of @StateObject for the view model
- Fix parameter ordering in both the main view initialization and preview provider

This aligns the card-based interface with the chat interface's working implementation, restoring voice recording and transcription
capabilities.
