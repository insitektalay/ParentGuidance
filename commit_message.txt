feat: fix contextual knowledge base navigation with NavigationLink approach

Fixed navigation issue in the "Your Child's World" contextual knowledge base where category cards were not responding to taps. The problem was  
caused by conflicting Button wrappers inside NavigationLink components.   

Key changes:  
- Refactored CategoryCard to separate visual content from button logic  
- Created CategoryCardContent view for use within NavigationLink destinations  
- Replaced failed navigationDestination approach with direct NavigationLink implementation  
- Removed conflicting onTap handlers that were preventing navigation   

The contextual knowledge base now properly navigates from category grid to individual insight views, completing the full user flow: Library →  
Your Child's World → Category Selection → Individual Insights with swipe-to-delete functionality.
