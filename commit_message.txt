feat: add animated transcribing overlay for voice input feedback    Implement floating "Transcribing..." animation that appears over the text input area during voice-to-text processing, providing clear visual   feedback to users.    New Component:   - TranscribingOverlay: Animated overlay with pulsing terracotta dots and "Transcribing..." text   - White semi-transparent background with subtle shadow for visibility   - Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions with scale and opacity effects    Integration:   - Added to SituationInputIdleView as ZStack overlay on TextEditor   - Triggered by voiceRecorderViewModel.isTranscribing state   - Positioned centrally over input area for optimal visibility    User Experience:   - Instant visual confirmation when recording stops and transcription begins   - Animated dots provide engaging feedback during processing   - Complements the white microphone button with terracotta checkmark state   - Maintains consistent design language with app's color palette    This completes the voice input feedback loop: recording (red pulsing button) → transcribing (white checkmark button + animated overlay) →   complete (normal button + transcribed text).
