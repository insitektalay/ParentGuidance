fix: Library tab dynamic guidance display and UX improvements

Fix Library tab to properly display dynamic guidance in swipeable cards and improve user experience with layout reordering and copy   functionality.

## Key Issues Fixed:
- Dynamic guidance was showing as "long vertical stream of text" instead of swipeable cards
- Display order showed original situation first, then guidance
- No copy functionality for original situation text
- Inconsistent experience across tabs for dynamic content

## Changes Made:

### Dynamic Structure Support
- Added @ObservedObject private var guidanceStructureSettings = GuidanceStructureSettings.shared to SituationDetailView
- Updated parseGuidanceContent() method to check user preference and use appropriate parser
- Integrated DynamicGuidanceParser for handling variable section counts (3-8 sections)
- Added parseFixedGuidanceContent() method for traditional 6-section format

### Card Display System
- Replaced hardcoded GuidanceCardsView component with flexible TabView+GuidanceCard system
- Updated guidance display to use same swipeable card interface as New Situation and Today tabs
- Added proper page indicators and navigation for variable section counts
- Improved fallback handling to show content in card format even when parsing fails

### Layout and UX Improvements
- Reordered display layout to show guidance cards first, then original situation below
- Added copy-to-clipboard button with clipboard icon next to "Original Situation" header
- Implemented haptic feedback and visual confirmation overlay for copy operations
- Added .textSelection(.enabled) for better text interaction

### Code Quality
- Removed obsolete GuidanceCardsView component
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing fixed guidance content

## Expected Outcome:
- Fixed guidance: Continues working correctly in swipeable cards (6 sections)
- Dynamic guidance: Now displays properly in swipeable cards (3-8 sections)
- Consistent swipeable card experience across all tabs (New, Today, Library)
- Enhanced user workflow with copyable situation text and improved layout
