feat: Add dynamic child age display to Settings tab

This commit implements dynamic child age formatting in the Settings Child Profile section, replacing the hardcoded "Not set" placeholder with 
actual child age data.

## Implementation Details:

### Child Model Research:
- Analyzed Child.swift model structure: stores age as `Int?` representing years
- Found existing age calculation pattern in OnboardingManager/AuthService using Calendar.dateComponents
- Identified formatting pattern "X years old" used in onboarding flow

### Age Formatting Logic:
- Added `formatChildAge(_ child: Child?) -> String` helper function to SettingsView
- Implemented proper singular/plural formatting: 
  - 1 year old (singular)
  - X years old (plural for ages > 1)
- Added comprehensive edge case handling: 
  - No child data: "Not set"
  - Missing age property: "Not set"
  - Invalid age (â‰¤0): "Not set"

### UI Integration:
- Updated Settings Child Profile age display (line 234) to use `formatChildAge(appCoordinator.children.first)`
- Replaced hardcoded "Not set" text with dynamic data from appCoordinator.children array
- Maintains existing styling and layout consistency

## User Experience Improvement:
- Settings now shows meaningful child information instead of placeholder text
- Age display matches the "X years old" pattern established in onboarding
- Graceful fallback to "Not set" when data is unavailable
- Foundation established for upcoming child profile editing functionality

## Technical Verification:
- Build tested successfully with ./test_build.sh
- No compilation errors or warnings
- Maintains existing app architecture patterns

This change completes Step 1 of the Basic Child Profile Management implementation, providing immediate value to users while establishing the 
foundation for child profile editing capabilities.
