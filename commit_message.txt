feat: Complete Settings Foundation Tools management implementation

This commit implements the complete Foundation Tools management system for the Settings tab, providing comprehensive framework management   capabilities:

## Framework Card Styling (Task 8):
- Updated FrameworkCard corner radius from 8px to 12px to match app standards
- Increased card padding from 12px to 16px for consistency with other cards
- Replaced variable opacity background with standard dark card color (Color(red: 0.21, green: 0.22, blue: 0.33))
- Updated button styling: font size 12px→14px, padding 12px→16px horizontal, corner radius 6px→8px
- Applied opacity differentiation (1.0 active, 0.8 inactive) for visual state indication
- Ensures visual consistency with FoundationToolCard and SituationCard components

## Framework Removal Confirmation Dialog (Task 7):
- Implemented frameworkRemovalConfirmationOverlay following LibraryView deletion pattern
- Added semi-transparent background overlay that cancels removal when tapped
- Custom ConfirmationDialog with "Remove Framework" title and permanent removal warning
- Dynamic button text showing "Removing..." during async operation
- Proper z-index (2000) to ensure dialog appears above all UI elements
- Connected to existing removal state management (prepareForRemoval, cancelRemoval, removeFramework)

## Testing and Verification (Task 9):
- Verified project builds successfully using ./test_build.sh
- Confirmed all Swift syntax and imports are correct
- Validated proper integration of all framework management components
- Verified state management follows SwiftUI best practices
- Confirmed design patterns match established app conventions
- Tested async/await patterns and error handling implementation

## Technical Implementation Details:
- Multi-framework support with Set<String> for activeFrameworkIds
- Proper @MainActor annotations for UI updates
- Comprehensive error handling with user-facing messages
- State cleanup after all operations (toggle, removal, cancellation)
- Database integration via FrameworkStorageService methods
- Consistent ColorPalette usage throughout

The Foundation Tools section now provides complete framework management functionality with professional UI/UX patterns, proper error handling,    and seamless database integration.
