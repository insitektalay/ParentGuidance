feat: add child regulation insights infrastructure with database schema and Swift models

Create foundation for Child_Regulation_Insights system prompt integration:
- Add insight_bullet_points table with RLS policies for storing individual behavioral observations
- Implement ChildRegulationInsight Swift model with Core/ADHD/Mild Autism categories
- Add ChildRegulationInsightsResponse model for OpenAI API response parsing
- Include convenience extensions for converting API responses to database records
- Support linking insights to specific children, situations, and families

This establishes the data layer for automatic extraction of nervous system traits,
emotional regulation patterns, and developmental observations from parent-submitted situations.
