fix: resolve keyboard spacing issue in chat interface using native SwiftUI approach

After 10+ failed attempts with custom keyboard handling solutions, replaced all manual keyboard observers, GeometryReader calculations, and   custom ViewModifiers with SwiftUI's native keyboard avoidance system.

Key changes:
- Stripped out all custom keyboard handling code from ChatConversationView
- Removed manual padding calculations and safe area adjustments
- Simplified layout back to basic VStack structure
- Implemented .ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard, edges: .bottom) for automatic keyboard handling

This native approach eliminates the persistent gap between input bar and keyboard that occurred with all previous manual implementations,   allowing SwiftUI to handle keyboard positioning and animation automatically.
