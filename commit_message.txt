fix: resolve duplicate user messages in chat interface
  - Remove duplicate user message addition from ChatConversationView.handleSend()
  - Keep only the user message addition in NewSituationView.handleChatMessage()
  - Parent view now has sole responsibility for managing chat messages state
  - Prevents user messages from appearing twice in the conversation
  - Maintains proper separation of concerns with parent controlling state
