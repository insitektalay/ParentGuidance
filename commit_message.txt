feat: add framework awareness to situation analysis workflow

Extend framework integration to the situation analysis step by updating the analyzeSituation function to accept and log active framework 
context while maintaining framework-agnostic analysis logic.

Key Changes:

- Updated ConversationService.analyzeSituation() function signature to accept optional FrameworkRecommendation parameter
- Added framework context logging when active framework is present during analysis
- Updated analyzeSituation call site in NewSituationView to pass detected active framework
- Maintained existing analysis prompt (pmpt_686b988bf0ac8196a69e972f08842b9a05893c8e8a5153c7) for objective situation categorization

Design Decision:

Situation analysis remains framework-agnostic to ensure objective categorization and incident classification. Framework integration occurs at
the guidance generation level where contextual advice is provided. This approach maintains analytical consistency while enabling comprehensive
framework-aware logging throughout the situation processing pipeline.

The complete workflow now has consistent framework detection and context passing from input → analysis → guidance generation → database
storage.
