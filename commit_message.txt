feat: add guidance structure preference setting in Settings

Complete Step 2 of dynamic guidance structure implementation by adding user preference controls in the Settings view.

## Key Features Added:
- New "Guidance Structure" section in SettingsView between Foundation Tools and Child Profile
- Integrated GuidanceStructureSettings as @StateObject for preference management
- Segmented picker allowing users to switch between Fixed and Dynamic structure modes
- Real-time mode description display explaining differences between options

## Technical Implementation:
- Added @StateObject private var guidanceStructureSettings to SettingsView
- Created guidanceStructureSection view with consistent styling matching existing patterns
- Implemented segmented picker with .colorScheme(.dark) for proper visibility
- Dynamic description text updates based on currentMode selection
- Leverages existing @AppStorage persistence from GuidanceStructureSettings class

## User Experience:
- Clear visual distinction between modes with descriptive explanations
- Fixed Structure: '7 consistent sections: Situation, Analysis, Action Steps, Phrases to Try, Quick Comebacks, and Support'
- Dynamic Structure: '3-8 flexible sections with AI-generated titles that adapt to your specific situation'
- Settings persist automatically across app sessions
- Immediate visual feedback when switching between modes

This completes Step 2 of the 6-step dynamic guidance structure implementation plan, enabling users to choose their preferred guidance format
while maintaining full backward compatibility.
