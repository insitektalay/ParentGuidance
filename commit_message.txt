feat: implement Phase 1 dual-language content foundation for two-parent families

Add comprehensive multilingual support infrastructure to enable AI-generated content in multiple languages when parents speak different   languages. This phase establishes the foundational data models and services needed for automatic dual-language content generation.

Key changes:
- Database schema: Added language tracking columns to profiles, situations, guidance, framework_recommendations, and contextual_insights tables
- Models: Enhanced UserProfile, Situation, Guidance, and FrameworkRecommendation with dual-language properties and helper methods
- Services: Implemented LanguageDetectionService (50+ languages via NaturalLanguage framework) and FamilyLanguageService for family language   configuration management
- UI: Added language selection interface in Settings with localized strings
- Architecture: Designed LanguageAwareContent protocol for consistent language support across all content types

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing English-only content. Sets foundation for Phase 2 AI translation integration.
