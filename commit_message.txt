fix: resolve persistent loading indicator in chat interface
- Add @Binding var isLoading to ChatConversationView for parent-managed loading state
- Add @State private var chatIsLoading to NewSituationView to control loading indicator
- Set chatIsLoading = true when user sends message
- Set chatIsLoading = false when AI response is received or error occurs
- Remove local loading state management from ChatConversationView handleSend method
- Ensures "Generating response..."\ indicator disappears when response is displayed
