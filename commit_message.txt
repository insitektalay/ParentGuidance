feat: implement instant microphone button feedback with transcribing state

Add immediate visual feedback for microphone button interactions by introducing a dedicated transcribing state with distinct visual indicators.

Visual States:
  - Recording: Red button with white stop icon + pulsing animation
  - Transcribing: White button with terracotta checkmark icon (static)
  - Idle: Terracotta button with white microphone icon

Implementation:
  - Add .transcribing state to VoiceRecorderService RecordingState enum
  - Update MicButton component with isTranscribing parameter and computed visual properties
  - Modify stopRecordingAndTranscribe to immediately transition to transcribing state
  - Update SituationInputIdleView and SituationFollowUpView to pass separate recording/transcribing states

User Experience Impact:
  - Button now responds instantly when pressed to stop recording
  - Clear visual indication that transcription is in progress
  - Eliminates perceived lag and provides better user feedback throughout the voice recording workflow

Resolves the slow microphone button response issue while maintaining proper state management and audio processing functionality.
