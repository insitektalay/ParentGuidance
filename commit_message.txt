feat: complete Essential Privacy Controls and Help & Support in Settings

This commit implements the final two priority sections of the Settings tab, completing the entire minimal essential Settings implementation as   planned.

## Essential Privacy Controls (Priority 4):

### Email-Based Data Export
- Implemented comprehensive data export functionality that emails user data as JSON
- Collects all user data across 6 categories: profile, children, situations, guidance, frameworks, and metadata
- Added loading states, success/error feedback, and proper error handling
- Ready for real email service integration (currently simulates email sending)

### Multi-Step Account Deletion
- Created 3-step confirmation process with increasing warnings to prevent accidental deletion
- Step 1: Warning with data categories, Step 2: "Are you sure?" confirmation, Step 3: Type "DELETE" verification
- Implemented complete database cleanup across all tables (frameworks, guidance, situations, children, profiles)
- Added loading states during deletion and automatic sign-out after successful completion

### Privacy Policy Display
- Added comprehensive privacy policy in modal sheet with 6 sections covering data collection, usage, storage, user rights, AI processing, and   contact information
- Clear explanations of BYOAPI handling and user data control options

## Help & Support (Priority 5):

### In-App Documentation
- Created comprehensive FAQ system with 4 sections: Getting Started, Using the App, Account & API Keys, and Troubleshooting
- 12 detailed FAQ items covering all major app features and common issues
- Modal presentation with clean, scrollable interface matching app design

### Contact Support System
- Implemented mailto integration with pre-populated support email
- Automatically includes technical context: app version, build number, iOS version, device model, and user ID
- Added fallback handling for devices without mail app configured
- Professional email template for efficient support workflow

### Enhanced App Information
- Dynamic app version and build number display from bundle info
- Tap-to-reveal debug information panel with iOS version, device model, and masked user ID
- Smooth animations for debug info expand/collapse
- Privacy-conscious display of sensitive information

## Technical Implementation:
- All features follow established app patterns for async operations, error handling, and UI consistency
- Uses existing ColorPalette and design system throughout
- Proper state management with loading states and user feedback
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Ready for production deployment with placeholder email service integration

This completes all 6 priorities from the original minimal essential Settings implementation plan, providing users with complete control over   their data, account, and access to help resources.
