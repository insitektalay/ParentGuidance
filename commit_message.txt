Title
refactor: remove voice recording navigation for in-place recording redesign
Description
Remove the two-step voice recording navigation in preparation for implementing direct in-place recording functionality. This change eliminates 
the separate SituationVoiceView screen and associated navigation logic.
Changes made:
- Remove showVoiceRecording state variable from NewSituationView
- Remove conditional rendering block for SituationVoiceView navigation
- Remove handleTranscriptionComplete() function (no longer needed)
- Temporarily disable onStartRecording callback with placeholder implementation
- Maintain existing text input functionality and app stability
This is Phase 1 of the voice recording UX redesign. The mic button now does nothing (logs message only) instead of navigating to a separate 
screen. Next phase will implement direct recording within the text input area.
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Transform from two-tap navigation flow to single-tap inline recording
ðŸ“± Impact: No user-facing changes yet - internal refactoring only
âœ… Verified: App builds successfully and all existing functionality preserved
